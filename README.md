# Computer Club #

This is the repository for Computer Club, with two years:

- 2012 Semester 2: This semester, we learnt programming and Python.

- 2013 Semester 1: This semester, we explored the world of Linux and broader computing concepts.

- 2013 Semester 2: This semester, we begin creating games in both 2D and 3D environments. 

- 2014 Term 2: This term, we looked at python again, catching up newer members, and looking at some modules.

I (Tom) Would like to thank Patrick O'Connell for this material, without his guidance over the past 3 years I wouldn't have been able to run the club at all. I'd also like to thank Bentley, who's continued support has been vital to the club.
