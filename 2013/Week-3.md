# Week 3 Summary #

This week, we're planning on going through the following things:

1) Resizing the VM window, and adjusting the VM screen resolution so you can use it in full screen, etc.
2) Finding your way around the LXDE desktop, customising the desktop, etc.
3) Package management, aka "The app store idea is a lot older than you might think". Why package management is a great strength of Linux. Packages you might want to try. FOSS replacements/versions of common apps you might use on your desktop at home.

Last week we're aware that some people thought we were going too slowly. We'll be providing some extra stuff for you to try, such as exploring the shell or some packages for some more advanced/specialised tasks, so you can keep occupied and have avenues which to explore at your own pace.

Please Note: this summary will be updated in the near future, and summaries of Week 4/5 will be added. -7/5/13
