# Starting With Computer Club 2013 #

This guide aims to show how you should set yourself up for Computer Club 2013. This guide also assumes that you just want to follow along without being too adventurous.

## Requirements ##

1. A USB Stick (preferably >= 8 GB)
2. Access to the "Computer Club" Folder on the S-Drive (ask for access at the club)

## Setting up your USB ##

1. Insert your USB Drive and ensure it is formatted as NTFS:
  - Right Click the drive in Windows Explorer, click format, select NTFS
  - >>>NOTE: FORMATTING WILL WIPE ALL DATA ON YOUR DRIVE<<<
  - You can then copy back the files you originally had, but please note that this will decrease the amount of space available to your virtual Linux installation

2. Go to the S-Drive and Locate the "Computer Club" Folder:
  - Copy both of the files in that folder onto your USB drive. It doesn't really matter where you put it. If you know what you're doing, get the VirtualBox installer straight from virtualbox.org.
  - Note: This could take some time, do only at a time in which the computers are not busy
  - Permissions should now have been set up, and the disk image is in the Computer Club folder for your use.

## Installing and setting up VirtualBox ##

1. Run the VirtualBox installer that you copied to your USB.
2. Read and follow the VirtualBox Setup Guide provided.

VirtualBox should be installed on all computers in the lab.

You can now startup the image as shown in the Week 2 club, and play with it if you like.
If you're especially daring/adept, you want to see the "Install Guide for pros" and build your own version of the image, or even try installing your own image.
